* You're on call, again...
It's 2 AM and the phone rings.  It's a nurse on the cardiac unit.  Mr. Smith is due to get his antiarrhythmic drug (who comes up with these crazy drug schedules?) and his ECG has a borderline prolonged QTc interval, at least according to the computer.  She's not sure if it is safe to give the drug.  The nurse wants to send you the ECG.

You open the ECG on your phone.  You look at the QT interval.  You're not sure about the computer's measurement.  You really should double check it.  You start counting little boxes.  You pull out the (t)rusty old pair of mechanical calipers some drug rep gave you many years ago, back when such largesse was still legal.  You think to yourself: I live in a digital age.  Am I really making measurements on my smart phone with a dumb pair of calipers?
* Electronic Calipers
*EP Calipers* provides *electronic calipers* for measuring intervals on images of electrocardiograms (ECGs) or electrophysiologic recordings.  In the electrophysiology lab electronic calipers are included as part of the recording system.  *EP Calipers* is intended to provide similar electronic calipers for use on your Android phone or tablet.  The electronic calipers of *EP Calipers* are more accurate, easier to use, and less dangerous than mechanical calipers (they don't have sharp points!).
* What's new?
This new version of *EP Calipers* can be used to analyze PDF files, as well as standard image files.  Multi-page PDF files are supported.  Thus the app can be used to analyze /AliveCor™/ files as well as academic papers in PDF format.
* Quick start
When *EP Calipers* starts, a sample ECG and a time caliper are loaded.
Move the caliper around by touching the caliper's cross-bar and
dragging it with your finger.  Expand and contract the caliper by
putting your finger on either vertical bar and dragging.  Pinch and
zoom the underlying ECG image as needed.  Drag the image around with
your finger.  Double-tap the ECG image to rapidly zoom in.
The remainder of these instructions will go over how to load ECG
images, add and delete calipers, calibrate the calipers and make
advanced measurements like the corrected QT interval.It's intuitive
* Loading an image
Use the *Image* button at the top right of the
screen to show the *Image* menu at the botton of your screen.

#+CAPTION: *Image* button
[image picture]

With this menu you can load and adjust an ECG image.  There are several ways to load and ECG image.
** Take a photo of an ECG
Touch the *Camera* button to take a photo of an ECG tracing and load
it into the app.  Note that images captured this way are not saved in
the photos collection of the device.  It's best to use this option to
make a quick measurement when you don't need to save the image.
** Select a photo from your photo gallery
Touch *Select* to chose an image that is already saved on your device in your photos collection (for example, an image file attached to an email that you saved or a photo that your previously took).
** Select a photo or PDF using the *Share* menu from other apps
*EP Calipers* can open image and PDF files regardless of where they are located on your device.  You can directly open email attachments, downloaded files, Google Drive, and Dropbox files.  It is also easy to open ECG images directly from the /AliveCor AliveECG™/ app.  The key to opening images in external apps is to use the *Share* button.  It looks like this: [share button image]

Here you can see the *Share* button at the top right of the /AliveECG/ screen:
#+CAPTION: *Share* button at top right

Once the *Share* menu is open, one of the options should be *EP Calipers*.  Selecting this option will open the image in the app.

** Multiple page PDFs
When PDF files have more than one page, the app will display the first page initially.  You can go to other pages by selecting *Previous* or *Next* in the Image menu.
* Adjusting the image
You can adjust the positioning of the image using pinch-to-zoom,
dragging, and double-tapping. Use the *Adjust* menu to fine-tune your
image further.  You can rotate the image by 90° in either direction,
or by increments of 1°.  This is particularly useful if the image is
rotated or not quite square to the screen.  You should recalibrate
your calipers after rotating the image.  If you need to go back to the
original image position use *Reset*.  After adjusting the image select
*Done* to return to the main image menu.
#+CAPTION: The *Adjust* menu
[image menu image]
* Exiting *Image* mode
After loading and adjusting the image, you need to exit Image mode so that you can use the calipers.  Select the *Measure* button at the top left of the screen to return to the *EP Calipers* main screen.
#+CAPTION: Use the *Measure* button to exit *Image* mode

* Moving calipers
Drag the crossbar of a caliper to move it as a unit.  Drag the left or right bars (or top or bottom in the case of vertical calipers) to stretch or shrink the calipers.  Note that you cannot pinch both bars at the same time.

* Making measurements
The interval measured by each caliper is displayed next to the crossbar of the caliper.  Until the calipers are calibrated, measurements are displayed in arbitrary units (points, roughly equivalent to screen pixels)).
* Adding and deleting calipers
Select the *+* or *Add Caliper* icon to add new calipers.[fn:1]
#+CAPTION: Main menu, prior to calibration
[main menu image]

Calipers can be horizontal (time measurements) or vertical (amplitude measurements).  Select *Time* or *Amplitude* to add the type of caliper you want.  Double-tap a caliper to delete it.
#+CAPTION: Add caliper menu
[add caliper menu]
* Selecting a caliper
When more than one caliper is present, it is necessary that one is selected to be the active caliper when calibrating or making calculated measurements.  By default an unselected caliper is blue and a selected caliper is red (You can change these colors if you want).  Single tapping an unselected caliper will select it.  Tap it again (but not too soon after the first tap, as a double tap deletes the caliper) will unselect it.  As there can be only one selected caliper at a time, selecting a caliper will unselect any other caliper that happens to be selected.  In some cases a caliper will be selected automatically (for example to do calibration) if you have not already selected one.  If you want to select a different caliper, just tap another caliper.
#+CAPTION: Two uncalibrated calipers, a time and amplitude.  The time caliper is selected.

* Calibration
Select *Cal* or *Calibrate*.[fn:1]  Stretch the selected caliper over a known interval (such as 1000 msec for time, or 10 mm for amplitude calipers).  Select *Set*.  In the dialog box, make sure the interval matches what you are measuring.  Enter both the calibration interval and units (e.g. 500 msec or 1 sec or 1 mV).  Select *Set* in the dialog box to set the calibration.  Time and amplitude calipers need to be calibrated separately.  Once calibrated, calipers will show intervals in the units used to calibrate.  Newly created calipers will use the same calibration.

* Changing calibration
You can recalibrate at any time.  You can clear all calibration by selecting *Clear* in the calibration toolbar.  Note that calibration is maintained if the device is rotated, or the image is zoomed.  Selecting a new image will reset calibration.
* Interval/Rate
Once a time (horizontal) caliper is calibrated, provided you use time units (such as msec or sec) for the calibration, it is possible to toggle between interval measurements (e.g. 600 msec) and heart rate measurements (e.g. 100 bpm) by selecting *Interval/Rate* or *I/R*.[fn:1]
* Mean rate and interval calculation
Select a calibrated caliper and stretch it over a number of intervals. Select *Mean Rate* or *mRate*[fn:1] and enter the number of intervals measured.  A dialog box will show the calculated mean heart rate and interval.  This is useful for calculating rates and intervals in irregular rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation.
* QTc calculation
Select *QTc*.  Stretch a time caliper over one or more RR intervals and select *Measure*.  Enter the number of intervals the caliper is stretched over and select *Continue*.  Then use the same caliper to measure the QT interval.  Select *Measure*.  A dialog box will give the calculated QTc using Bazett's formula.

* Settings
Preferences such as caliper colors and default calibration intervals can be selected using the *Settings* menu item on the toolbar at the top of the app.
* Device rotation
Caliper calibration as well as scaling and rotation of the ECG image are maintained with device rotation.  Calipers may need to be repositioned after device rotation.  If the device is rotated in the middle of doing the steps of the QTc calculation it will be necessary to start the calculation over.
